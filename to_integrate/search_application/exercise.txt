Medium level design

We want to write a notes/search application.

What is a note?
- A note is two items:
	"title" of the note (limited by 40 characters).
	"text" of the note (limited by 1000 character).
	Try to keep the limits flexible.

The web app
- main page:
	- button to add a note, modify a note, remove a note, search
	- show number of notes in the es.
- search page:
	- textbox for entering the search
	- button to do the search
	- this page will to the results page
- results page:
	- show number of results (total), which results are display on this page
	("showing 20-30 results out of 43")
	- results will show both the title and the description.

Features:
- User can add/remove/edit notes.
- User can search notes. A search will search both title and text.
- If a search matches more than X notes then paginate the results.

Limits on number of notes?
- no need to set limit now.

What about users?
Only one user for now.
