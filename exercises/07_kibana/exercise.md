# Kibana Exercise: Data Visualization and Analysis

## Overview
This exercise will guide you through using Kibana to analyze and visualize data from multiple sources. You'll work with web logs, e-commerce transactions, system metrics, and application logs to create meaningful dashboards and perform various queries.

## Prerequisites
- Elasticsearch and Kibana running locally
- Python 3.x with `faker` library installed
- Basic understanding of JSON and log formats

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install faker
```

### 2. Generate Sample Data
```bash
# Generate all types of sample data (4000 records total)
python generate_sample_data.py --count 1000 --output sample_data.json

# Or generate specific data types
python generate_sample_data.py --type web_logs --count 500 --output web_logs.json
python generate_sample_data.py --type ecommerce --count 500 --output ecommerce.json
```

### 3. Import Data into Elasticsearch
```bash
# Create the index and import data
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/sample-data" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "timestamp": { "type": "date" },
      "ip_address": { "type": "ip" },
      "status_code": { "type": "integer" },
      "response_time_ms": { "type": "integer" },
      "cpu_usage_percent": { "type": "float" },
      "memory_usage_percent": { "type": "float" },
      "total_amount": { "type": "float" },
      "data_type": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}'

# Import the data
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/sample-data/_bulk" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @sample_data.json
```

## Part 1: Basic Kibana Queries and Filters

### Exercise 1.1: Discover Data
1. Open Kibana (http://localhost:5601)
2. Go to **Discover** and create an index pattern for `sample-data`
3. Set the time field to `timestamp`

**Tasks:**
- Explore the different data types by filtering on `data_type`
- Find all HTTP 404 errors in web logs
- Locate e-commerce transactions over $100
- Identify system metrics where CPU usage > 80%

### Exercise 1.2: KQL (Kibana Query Language) Practice

Write KQL queries for the following:

1. **Web Traffic Analysis:**
   ```
   data_type: "web_log" AND status_code: 404
   data_type: "web_log" AND response_time_ms > 1000
   data_type: "web_log" AND method: "POST" AND status_code: [200 TO 299]
   ```

2. **E-commerce Insights:**
   ```
   data_type: "ecommerce" AND total_amount > 100
   data_type: "ecommerce" AND product_category: "Electronics" AND payment_method: "credit_card"
   data_type: "ecommerce" AND customer_age: [25 TO 35] AND is_mobile: true
   ```

3. **System Monitoring:**
   ```
   data_type: "system_metrics" AND cpu_usage_percent > 80
   data_type: "system_metrics" AND memory_usage_percent > 70 AND cpu_usage_percent > 70
   server_name: "server-01" AND load_average > 2.0
   ```

4. **Application Logs:**
   ```
   data_type: "application_log" AND level: "ERROR"
   service: "payment-service" AND duration_ms > 500
   level: ("ERROR" OR "FATAL") AND service: "auth-service"
   ```

### Exercise 1.3: Time-based Filtering
